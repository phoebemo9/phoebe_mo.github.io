## Work Experience
* Title: Software Engineering Internship (Jul. 2019 - Sep. 2019)

* Company: Tencent Computer System Co. Ltd

* Responsibilities:

  * Programming internship of front-end web and back-end development. Mainly focus on developing a program called "Family Guard", whose main goal is to offer family control on monitoring teenagers' use of time in playing games.
  
  * Responsible for adding new methods to deal with user data between front-end and database, such as applying and storing.
  
  * Participated in implementing new functions and improving efficiency based on user demands.

## Programming Projects

* Tetris Game
  * Java GUI and basic data structures were used to design this traditional user-interactive game
  
* Imitation of Block Chain
  * A mini program of imitation for digging virtual coins using Java language to implement
  * Using different data structures (especially linked list), hash functions, data storage, and basic concepts of cryptocurrency

* Searching Tool
  * A tool to search for a specific word (words) with their counts in a given file according to specific requirements
  * This program is implemented by C language. Sorting, searching, and memory operations are greatly used

* Six Degrees of Kelvin Bacon
  * Using DFS, BFS, Dijkstra algorithm, and Disjoint Sets in C++ to efficiently search for relationships between two persons.
Graph theory and tree properties are also widely used throughout this project
  * Analyze/Improve efficiency given by different algorithms by inspecting their performance in the program
